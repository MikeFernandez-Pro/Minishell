# Minishell
The purpose of this project was to recreate a part of a shell.

To do this, the following builtins had to be implemented : 
- echo with the option '-n'
- cd (only with an absolute or relative path)
- pwd
- export
- unset
- env
- exit

We also had to implement the redirects '<', '>' and '>>', pipe and environment variables management and a gestion of ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\.
